This app features several screens and functionalitites to support these needs, such as the Home Screen for an overview of current weight and goals, the History Screen for detailed weight history and progress, and the Goal Screen for setting and monitoring weight goals. Personalized notifications further enhance the user experience by keeping them motivated and informed.

**User-Centered UI Design**

The UI design focuses on simplicity and accessibility, ensuring a smooth user experience. The clean layout, intuitive navigation, and clear visual cues make it easy for users to interact with the app. The success of the design is reflected in positive user feedback and engagement, demonstrating that the app effectively meets user needs and provides a user-centered interface.

**Coding Approach**

The app was developed using a modular approach, with clear separation of concerns. Key techniques and strategies included the Model-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for organized and maintainable code, dependency injection to manage dependencies efficiently, and unit tesing to ensure code reliability. These strategies promote scalable and maintainable codebases and will be beneficial in future projects.

**Testing and Functional Assurance**

Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure the app's functionality, including unit tests to verify individual components, integration tests to check interactions between components, and user testing to gather feedback and identify usability issues. Testing is crucial for identifying and resolving bugs, improving code quality, and ensuring a positive user experience. The testing process revealed areas for improvement and helped ensure that the app functions as intended.

**Innovation and Challenges**

Throughout the app development process, several challenges were encountered and overcome through innovative solutions. One significant challenge was implementing secure user authentication, which required robust security measures to protect user data. Another challenge was integrating SMS notifications seamlessly to engage users and keep them informed about their progress. These innovative solutions contributed to the app's success and demonstrated the team's ability to overcome obstacles.
